   - ✅ Added proper async/await support

## Current Focus
We are working on integrating the meme coin detection into the SearchView. The implementation successfully identifies trending meme coins using a sophisticated scoring algorithm.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Integrate meme coin detection into SearchView:
   - Add filtering options for meme/non-meme coins
   - Update UI to display meme coin indicators
   - Add score display for debugging purposes
   - Implement refresh functionality

2. SearchView UI Updates:
   - Design meme coin badge/indicator
   - Add sorting options (by volume, score, date)
   - Improve token information display
   - Add pull-to-refresh functionality

3. Future Enhancements:
   - Add token search functionality
   - Enhance token categorization
   - Implement swap functionality with Jupiter SDK
   - Add market data visualization
   - Consider adding score threshold configuration
   - Implement caching for token data

## API Endpoints in Use
- Jupiter Token List: `https://tokens.jup.ag/tokens?tags=birdeye-trending`
  - Returns trending tokens with volume data
  - No API key required
  - Includes detailed token metadata

## Notes
- Successfully implemented meme coin detection algorithm
- Moved to protocol-based architecture for better testing
- Need to consider UI/UX for displaying meme coin status
- Consider adding configuration options for scoring thresholds
- May need to implement rate limiting in the future

## Questions to Address
1. How to effectively display meme coin status in the UI?
2. Should we add user-configurable scoring thresholds?
3. Do we need additional metadata for better detection?
4. How to handle token logo/image loading efficiently?

## Last Updated
- Implemented meme coin detection service
- Added protocol-based architecture
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Next focus is SearchView integration

## Search View Implementation

### Current Implementation

1. **Search View Components**:
   - Implemented `SearchBarView` with text input and filter button
   - Added token logo support with `AsyncImage` and fallback to symbol-based images
   - Integrated recent tokens section with horizontal scrolling pills
   - Added trending meme coins section with live data fetching

2. **Token Display**:
   - `SearchTokenRow` shows:
     - Token logo (with async loading and fallback)
     - Token name and symbol
     - Price and 24h price change
     - Swap button with arrow icon

3. **Navigation**:
   - Search view dismisses with "Cancel" button
   - Selecting a token navigates to SwapView
   - Recent tokens are limited to 5 entries

4. **Data Management**:
   - Recent tokens persist during session
   - Trending tokens fetch from API via `TrendingTokensViewModel`
   - Token model updated with `logoURI` support

### Next Steps

1. **Search Functionality**:
   - Implement live search filtering for tokens
   - Add debounce to search input
   - Integrate with token price API for real-time data

2. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add loading states for token price updates
   - Implement pull-to-refresh for trending tokens
   - Add empty state designs for no results

3. **Token Management**:
   - Persist recent tokens between sessions
   - Add token favorites functionality
   - Implement token blacklist for spam protection

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement image caching for token logos
   - Add pagination for large token lists
   - Optimize network requests

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
   - Implement offline mode support
   - Add error states for network issues

## DexScreener API Integration

### Implementation Status
1. **Token Price Fetching**:

   - ✅ Implemented token price updates in search view
   - ✅ Added proper error handling for API responses

2. **Token Details Integration**:
   - ✅ Implemented two-step process for fetching token details:
     - First fetch token pairs using token address
     - Then fetch specific pair details using pair address
   - ✅ Added proper error handling and null response handling
   - ✅ Improved logging for debugging API responses

3. **Data Models**:
   - ✅ Created comprehensive models for DexScreener responses:
     - `DexScreenerResponse`
     - `PairData` with nested models for tokens and metrics
   - ✅ Added proper optional handling for nullable fields
   - ✅ Implemented computed properties for formatted values

### API Endpoints in Use

### Next Steps
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed token data
   - Add rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
   - Optimize network requests by batching token queries

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
   - Implement fallback data sources
   - Add user feedback for API errors
